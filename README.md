# RTBuild
RTBuild is a simple C/C++ build system hacked together (in Python 2.7) because all the others were either too convoluted (CMake, GNU Autotools), unfinished (GYP, Premake), or platform-restricted (MSBuild).

### Version
Beta 0.9

### Installation and Usage
See the *samples* folder for usage samples.

### Todo's
 - See RTBuild.html
 - Do proper documentation.
 - Rework custom tools to use a "generator" class, allowing the use of project settings such as include directories.
 - ~~Account for non-local executions.~~ Done
 - Add an optional "filters" option, used for filters in MSVC.
